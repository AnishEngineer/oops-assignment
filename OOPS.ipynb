        "#1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which are instances of classes. These objects can contain data in the form of fields (also known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of methods (functions associated with an object).\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea is to model software around real-world entities, making programs easier to understand, maintain, and scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "💡 Key Concepts of OOP:\n",
        "Class\n",
        "A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object\n",
        "An instance of a class. It's a specific implementation that holds actual data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation\n",
        "Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (object). It also hides the internal state of the object from the outside (data hiding).\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction\n",
        "Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance\n",
        "A way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. The new class (child or subclass) inherits attributes and methods from the existing class (parent or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism\n",
        "The ability to use a single interface to represent different underlying data types. For example, a method name can be used for different types of behavior depending on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a self-contained unit that consists of:\n",
        "\n",
        "Attributes (or properties): The data or state of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Methods (or functions): The behaviors or actions the object can perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is created from a class, which acts like a blueprint. While the class defines the structure, the object is the actual instance with real values.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Ans:- Encapsulation Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (object). It also hides the internal state of the object from the outside (data hiding).\n",
        "\n",
        "#5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Dunder methods (short for “double underscore” methods) in Python are special methods that start and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, or __add__.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are also called magic methods, and they let you define how objects of your class behave with built-in operations like printing, adding, comparing, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "#6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "Ans:- Inheritance is an OOP concept where a class (called the child or subclass) inherits the properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) of another class (called the parent or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps in code reusability and establishes a \"is-a\" relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#7. What is polymorphism in OOP.\n",
        "Ans:- Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" In Object-Oriented Programming, it refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method name in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows you to write code that works on objects of different classes as long as they follow the same interface or have similar methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "#8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Ans:- Encapsulation is an OOP concept that means wrapping data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit — the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "It also means restricting access to some parts of an object to protect the internal state. Think of it like putting data behind a protective barrier and only allowing controlled access.\n",
        "\n",
        "#9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-In Python (and OOP in general), a constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when a class is instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the constructor is always named __init__.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans:- class methods and static methods in Python, two powerful tools for writing clean and organized object-oriented code.\n",
        "\n",
        "#11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Ans:-Method Overloading means having multiple methods with the same name in a class, but with different parameters (number or type). It's a way to let a method behave differently depending on the arguments passed to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Ans:-Method overriding is when a child class defines a method with the same name as a method in its parent class, but changes its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you call that method on an object of the child class, the child’s version of the method is used — even if the object is being referenced as a parent type.\n",
        "\n",
        "#13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-The  Property decorator allows you to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute — meaning you can call a method without parentheses, and it feels like accessing a variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "#14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the main benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. ✅ Simplifies Code\n",
        "You can write general-purpose functions that work with a variety of object types.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. 🔄 Enables Flexible and Extensible Code\n",
        "You can add new classes with their own implementation of shared methods without changing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. 🧱 Supports Code Reuse\n",
        "Reuse functions and classes in different contexts — makes code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. 🔒 Encapsulates Behavior\n",
        "You don’t need to know an object’s class — just that it can perform the method you're calling.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. 📦 Key to Interfaces and Abstract Base Classes\n",
        "Polymorphism enables patterns like duck typing and the use of interfaces/abstract classes to define behavior expectations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be inherited by other classes. It often serves as a blueprint for other classes, enforcing that certain methods must be implemented in any subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#16.   What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "Ans:- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming Plus) isn't a universally defined term like OOP, but it's often used informally to describe enhanced or modern OOP practices that incorporate newer paradigms and improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "Instance Variable:\n",
        "\n",
        "            Belongs to one object\n",
        "\n",
        "            Unique for each instance\n",
        "\n",
        "            Defined inside the constructor\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variable:\n",
        "\n",
        "            Belongs to the class itself\n",
        "\n",
        "            Shared across all instances\n",
        "\n",
        "            Defined outside any method in the class body\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, a subclass gets the methods and attributes from multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-  In Python, the __str__ and __repr__ methods are special methods used to define how objects of a class are represented as strings. They serve slightly different purposes, and here's a breakdown of each:\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__(self)\n",
        "Purpose: Returns a user-friendly string representation of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used by: str() function and print() statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal: Meant to be readable and nicely formatted for end users\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__(self)\n",
        "Purpose: Returns a developer-friendly string representation of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used by: repr() function and interactive interpreter (e.g., Jupyter, Python shell).\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal: Meant to be unambiguous, often including details useful for debugging. Ideally, it should return a string that could be used to recreate the object (if possible).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-super() is a built-in function in Python that gives you access to methods from a parent or sibling class — without explicitly naming them.\n",
        "\n",
        "You typically use it in inheritance to call methods from the superclass (i.e., parent class).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- The __del__ method in Python is a special method known as a destructor. It's automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when there are no more references to it. Its main role is to handle cleanup activities before the object is removed from memory. For example, if an object opened a file or held a network connection, the __del__ method can be used to close the file or disconnect safely.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "Ans:-In Python, both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods that are not regular instance methods, but they serve different purposes and behave differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "A @staticmethod is a method that does not take a reference to the class or instance as its first argument. It behaves just like a regular function but lives inside the class's namespace. It doesn’t know anything about the class or instance—it's simply a utility function that’s grouped with the class for organizational reasons.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a @classmethod takes the class itself (cls) as the first argument, rather than the instance (self). This means it has access to class-level data and can modify class state. It’s often used for factory methods, where you want to create class instances in a specific way, or to operate on class variables that are shared among all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Polymorphism in Python works beautifully with inheritance by allowing different classes in the same inheritance hierarchy to provide their own implementations of a method while sharing the same method name. This means you can write code that works on a superclass type but behaves differently depending on which subclass is actually being used — all without changing the code that calls the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Ans:- Method chaining in Python (especially in object-oriented programming) is a technique where multiple method calls are made in a single line, one after another, using dot (.) notation. Each method returns the object itself (usually self), allowing the next method to be called on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "Ans:- The __call__ method in Python is a special (or \"dunder\") method that allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of __call__:\n",
        "It enables objects to behave like functions. When you define __call__ in a class, you can \"call\" an instance of that class using parentheses and pass arguments to it, just like you would with a regular function.\n",
